  word would really really help.
- Changed version to beta12
- Add config option to the unreal service utility options are:
  unreal config startup auto|manual
    auto starts the service when the pc boots, manual requires you to run Unreal manually
  unreal config crashrestart delay (2k/XP only)

  ANTI_SPAM_QUIT_TIME - it simply replaces it with the message if enabled
- Make makecert.bat and encpem.bat show their use in titlebar when run

- Added set::ssl::options, with three options:
    fail-if-no-clientcert   - If SSL client connects and doesn't provide a client certificate, abort connection immediately
    verify-certificate      - Check the certificate's validity using X509 methods, check if we trust CA's, etc. 
                              It however does slip self signed certificates through UNLESS
    no-self-signed          - Don't allow self-signed certificates through (requires verify-certificate)

  stable. See aliases/aliases.conf for the format changes
- Numerous Sts-coded-conf3-while-sick bugs
- Added SVSLUSERS, allows changing of local/global max users. This is designed so services
  can make sure all servers report the same global max and that a local max can be adjusted
  if for example a clone flood occurs. It is NOT designed to make the max count higher than
  you actually have.
- Fixed a bug in the win32 debugger where the contents of the core file were not written
  until ok was clicked. Reported by Simon Bell.

- Made modules correctly rehash, this involves adding a Mod_Test function to modules that
  need to perform configuration tests. This is currently only implimented for dynamic linking
- Made the same system work under static linking. This (barring any bugs) should be the
  completion of conf3. :)
- Fixed a bug where chmode +q users could not kick chmode +a users. (#0000459) reported by
  jollino.

- Fixed exception in scanner on Windows
- Changed base version name to Unreal3.2, instead of Unreal3.2-Selene
- Made McSkaf part of core coder team
*** beta13 released ***
- Added set::htm to set HTM options via the config. set::htm is only valid if either
  commands.so or m_htm.so is loaded.
- Recoded some of +G to work MUCH faster. A compiled copy of the regex is now stored 
  in memory rather than compiling the regex each time the swear stripping was trigged. 
  This uses slightly more memory, but saves a signifigant amount of execution time.
  Idea inspired by a suggestion from CaliMonk

- Fixed a bug where leaving out the parameter to a password config entry would cause a
  crash, reported by AngryWolf (#0000623)

- Fixed set::dns error messages
- Fixed win32 compile error
- Fixed chmode +u again.
- Fixed a bug reported by mQ where it was possible to include spaces in a TKL host

- Fixed remote /rehash bug (#0000600).
- Documentation updates (unreal32docs.html, example.conf).
- Added a new badword type, quit. This replaces the old CENSOR_QUIT. If you want to censor
  quit messages you create a badword quit {}. Additionally loading badwords.quit.conf will
  censor several badwords by default. Based on suggestions by Gargo
- Fixed two ident bugs (multihomed&connect), both resulted in ident not working.
- Added set::options::dont-resolve (=hostnames of incomming clients won't be resolved).
- Code cleanup (gcc 3.2 warnings with -Wall).
- Removed/updated some NS stuff
- Added EventMarkDel which marks an event for deletion for the (next) DoEvents() call.
- Fixed /rehash stall caused by delayed unloading of the scan module (deadlock).

- Fixed a bug where +x would make hosts lowercase (#0000810) reported by rayman
- Implemented a ban version {} (bans users based on CTCP VERSION). It works by sending out
  a CTCP VERSION when a user connects then checking the reply. If you don't use any 
  ban version{}'s then no version request is sent so users are not inconvenienced.
- Rewrote the "flood from unknown connection" system to kill all matching users immediately
  and also added set::anti-flood::unknown-flood-bantime and 
  set::anti-flood::unknown-flood-amount to set the length of time an unknown connection
  flooder is banned for and how much data (in KB) the user must send before being banned.
  This should fix (#0000767) reported by ora.
- Updated some documentation
- (Hopefully) fixed some Ziplinks problems
- Added missing except tkl {} documentation
- Documentation update and cleanup

- Fixed a typo in the docs for except throttle (#0000830) reported by CoNfOuNd
- Added set::modes-on-join to set channel modes that are set when a new channel is created.
- Fixed a typo in the HTM docs (#0000832) reported by CoNfOuNd
- Added anti-away-flood code, based on Bahamut. This prevents users from repeatedly using /away.
  This feature is disabled by default (see NO_FLOOD_AWAY in config.h). 
- Added set::anti-flood::away-count and set::anti-flood::away-period to control the away flood
  system.
- Moved the "missing user in SJOIN" notice to snomask +j
- Rewrote some of the set::allow-userhost-change code. Fixes (#000843) and (#0000791) reported

  undeffing of THROTTLING
- Fixed a set::modes-on-join bug and fixed an oob read in config parser.
- Fixed an oper bug with /names on a +s channel (#0000816).
- Fixed 2 other oob reads in config parser (parsing of size and time).
- Fixed yet another oob read in config parser (ie: #0000841).
- Fixed a typo in the docs (#0000867) reported by tc
- Fixed a fast badword replace crash (#0000834) reported by orga

- Made gline/zline/kline take precedence over a shun in TKL (#0000870) reported by KnuX`
- Fixed a long standing typo where doc/example.conf still mentioned oflag e (#0000638)
  reported by twigboy.
- Possibly fixed an SSL crash bug (#0000871 and #000784) reported by shotgun and comrade
- Fixed opermode bug which could cause the ircd to crash a while later (#0000823).
- Changed throttling errormsg so mIRC recognizes it and waits a while.
- Added SSL quit error messages
- Fixed an SQLINE bug with sqlines without a reason
- Fixed a bug effecting additions/deletions of SQLINES and deletions of SVSNLINES (may be
  the cause of #0000866)
- Fixed MAJOR "messages are lost" bug which can cause various problems: ziplink corruption,
  duplicate user entry in sjoin, etc etc. This would happen if BUFFERPOOL was set too low (like
  the default) and you got a lot of traffic. It's now handled a bit better and you'll get
  a nice warning, additionally the default BUFFERPOOL is now set to MAXSENDQLENGTH*18 instead of
  *9. Thanks to ora and others which helped me tracing this down.
- Added tld::options::ssl so you can have different motd/rules files if the user is using SSL.
- Fixed cloaking bug reported by Rocko (#0000869).
- Added set::restrict-channelmodes, works exactly the same as restrict-usermodes, you can for
  example disallow using of channelmode u and L. Suggested by poisoner and others (#0000838).

- Improved IPv6 throttle hashing
- Make the above actually work
- Improved throttle hashing (both IPv4 and IPv6).
- Changed throttling so it now bans after M connects in N seconds rather than 2 connects in N 
  seconds. (set::throttle::connections).
- Updated channelmode +f "algorithm", much better now. Reported by JimmyZ, Rocko, and others.
- Added badword::action <replace|block>. (replace is default). If you specify block, instead
  of replacing the word with "<censored>" it will block the message from ever being sent. 
  (#0000557) suggested by paranomix
- Made /stats b output badword quit {} (#0000883) reported by AngryWolf
- Made except ban {} override ban ip {} (suggested by Lithium).
- Removed some old defines for the old password encryption system (#0000765) reported by
  AngryWolf
- Made it so you can use a ~ as the first character of an ident with /chgident (#0000765)
  reported by AngryWolf

- Updated some documentation
- Minor error msg improvements
- Fixed a bug with wrong hub/leaf settings ("non-hub introduced leaf") causing a crash 
  (#0000732).

  (#0000895) reported by Troco
- Added some information to the docs listing the file names for motd, rules, etc. (#0000519)
  suggested a LONG time ago by Jaw959

- Added some temporarely SQLINE debugging/trace code
- Fixed a PRIVMSG channelprefix bug reported by aragon (#0000902)
- Fixed far connect (+s +F): connects from U-lined servers are now hidden again.
- Added IP bans like *!*@194.109.* (#0000474).
- Fixed usermode +S: was accidently a local usermode (#0000909) reported by DukePyrolator.
- Enabled throttling support by default, you need to have a (correct) set::throttle block
  to make it work, otherwise it's just turned off.
- Some code cleanups (s_conf.c, now has a config_setdefaultsettings()).
- Fixed minor badwords /rehash memleak.
- Added link::options::nohostcheck which makes Unreal not to validate the incomming host/IP
  against the link::hostname field, useful for dynamic DNS hosts.
- Some documentation improvements regarding link::hostname.
- Changed the module umode adding function to allow an 'is_allowed' function. This fuction
  defines who may set the specified usermode.
- Made it so Ulined servers can use a TS that is in the past for topics (#0000448) reported 
  by thilo
- Fixed a bug with ban version {} where some clients didn't like the request we were sending.

- Preparing beta16: release notes ready, version updated in docs/text (except version.h).
- Changed version to beta16
- Various docs typo fixes, some reported by AngryWolf (#0000913)
- Mm, let's see what this checkin brings: 
  * Removed thread questions from Config, and autoconf code from
    configure.in, leaving in the old macros though, but inactive
    --enable-standardthreads is dead as of now
  * Undefined HOOKTYPE_SCAN_INFO
  * Removed CONF_EXCEPT_SCAN
  * Removed locking in events, Lock/UnlockEventSystem still active for other
    possible uses.
  * Removed scanners, web server module
  * Removed except scan {}
  * Removed SCAN_API stuff from l_commands.c, win32 makefiles, etc
  * Removed basically any mentions of threads in source tree, excepting
    threads.h which Resolver uses on win32
  * Documentation changes not done yet
- Updated docs [unreal32docs/example.conf] (maybe not all yet), win zip makefile fixed
- Module coders: I've changed HOOKTYPE_PRE_LOCAL_CONNECT, you must now return '0' to let
  the client pass and anything else is threated like a return, so you must return
  FLUSH_BUFFER if you just called exit_client, this fixes a read-already-freed-mem bug.
- Added warning message if set::scan exists
- Made SVSNOOP work. Reported by Lx (#0000933).
- Removed some more html files.
- Removed CREDITS.POTENTIAL
- Removed 'bugreport'
*** beta16 release ***

  (#0000942) reported by Rocko
- Added verification that a vhost::vhost is valid (#0000924) reported by AngryWolf and ChRiS
- Fixed "make install" error caused by bugreport file removal.
- Removed some leftover +I code (can_stealth/^).
- Fixed a badword::action block bug with regex (non-fast) badwords, could cause a crash,
  reported by auspice (#0000946).
- Fixed unprecise RPING output at windoze, reported by pak (#0000945).
- Fixed a bug where operoverride notices were not send when overriding chmodes +aq (#0000831)
  reported by _SciFi_
- Fixed a bug in SVSMODE with setting -b on a user in a channel
- Recoded the "version flag" system, it is now safe to have multiple modules that use the 
  same flag, new functions are VersionflagAdd and VersionflagDel they replace flag_add and
  flag_del
- Fixed a local /kill bug during connection phase, reported by Gilou (#0000952).
- Fixed ripemd-160 vs ripemd160 confusion, reported by thelight (#0000949).
- Little find_client() audit.
- Removed some leftover TECHAT references (#0000953).
- Added a CommandExists function to be used by module coders to determine if a command already
  exists.
- Renamed channel mode +a to "channel admin" it fits better, and it makes us more consistent 
  with other IRCds.
- Made the command parsing loop slightly faster by validating command parameters when a command
  is created rather than when a command is used.
- Made ban version {} also listen for CTCP SCRIPT replies. Some scripts apparently use this to
  report their version info.
- Made it so NETINFO won't report a different cloak key error if the server specifies * for the
  cloak keys. Useful for services that rely on VHP.
- Misc /whois and webtv whois fixes
- Added CASEMAPPING=ascii as per request
- /WHO code cleanup + partial recode + bugfixes
- Updated example.conf about U-lines since many people set them wrong.
- Fixed numeric checking.
- Moved /stats zip from NOTICE to RPL_TEXT, updated stats documentation.
- Made it so it is no longer necessary to copy the ModuleInfo structure passed to Mod_Test
  and Mod_Init. Unreal now does this internally.

- And another minor +L fix.
- Minor channelmode +f fix.
- IPv6: Fixed unable-to-resolve-bug if both a A/AAAA record and NS/MX/etc records were present
  for the same hostname, reported by Byte (#0000972).
- Updated flags in /version (and greeting), added 'Z' for zip links support, updated tech doc.
- Added set::ident::connect-timeout (default 10s) and set::ident::read-timeout (default 30s) to
  have much more control over ident timeouts, this should also fix connection timeout problems
  during connecting.
- Updated example.conf (added throttle block).
- Made some fixes to the resolver code under Win32
- Fixed a bug in del_throttling_bucket 
- Code cleanup (sys_errlist[])
- Fixed a crash in SVSMOTD that could occur if invalid parameters were used. Reported by 
  emigrant
- Committed little de-Fizzer module to extras/
- Check in autoconf for MacOS X that will make compiling and running on it 
  to work
- Possibly fixed a compile problem on Solaris/SunOS (#0000984) reported by Dom
- Added deny channel::redirect, which allows you to forward a client to another channel
  if the one he/she joined is not allowed. can also be used for channel "aliases" like
  #operhelp sends people to #help
- Made it so Unreal always uses extended regex support
- Fixed the compile problem on Solaris/SunOS (#0000984) reported by Dom
- Updated src/win32/unrealinst.iss a bit
- Changed /who flag '&' to '?'
- Fixed regex detection problem (introduced by a change 2 days ago).
- Added set::options::mkpasswd-for-everyone to let normal users use /mkpasswd, requested
  by Evats.
- Added error messages if not oper for: sdesc, mkpasswd, htm, rping, opermotd (#0000988).
- Removed the old TSP stuff from the extras directory, this is no longer used and it just
  wastes space.
- Made /whois work slightly faster
- Probably fixed server-notices bug (duplicates, to non-opers) caused by a few SVS* cmds,
  reported by _loco_ (#0000991).
- Fixed a bug in the win32 editor reported by ChAoS^TiGeR
- Fixed /map bug that permitted trivial finding of U-lined servers
- Fixed bug in HOOKTYPE_LOCAL_JOIN which could cause 0-member-channels if a hook returned
  1 and the channel was new.
- Made it so a permanent /kline no longer says "Permanent Timed K:line" which can be confusing
  (#0000997) reported by AngryWolf
- Module coders: new hooks: part, kick, chanmode, topic. changed: quit (added 'comment' param).
- Enlarged REPORT_* vars a bit.
- IPv6: UnrealIRCd can now lookup ip6.arpa addresses too (original IRCnet patch modified for
  UnrealIRCd by Onliner).
- Doc updates
- Removed "Duplicate user entry in SJOIN" notice because the problem has been traced down.
- Fixed some ./Config problems on Solaris with IPv6, SSL, and some other misc. things 
  (#0001004) reported by lion.
- Changed the /whois "secret channel" flag from '~' to '?'
- Fixed some MOTD problems: remote MOTD gone after rehash (#0001007) and motd time, etc...
- Fixed _some_ gcc3.3 + -Wall warnings.
- Fixed a bug where the win32 config editor could crash if the file contained color codes.
- Resolver fix nr #1 (prolly not "the real problem").
- Minor oob fix for parse_v4_netmask
- Fixed another serious bug in the win32 resolver.
- Removed mutex stuff from rem_request, no longer needed, should make the resolver much
  faster.
- Implemented short motds (ircd.smotd). If you don't know what short motds are, read on:
   short motds are a method of conserving bandwidth. When a user connects ircd.smotd
   is displayed (or a tld::shortmotd). This file contains brief text. Alternatively,
   ircd.motd (or tld::motd) is displayed when a user types /motd. The idea behind this is
   instead of displaying huge ASCII art, and tons of text to every user when they connect
   (since most users will ignore it anyway) you only show that stuff to users who specifically
   request it. Also, if you choose not to use short motds, everything will function as it used
   to the ircd.motd (or tld::motd) will be displayed both when users connect and /motd.
- Changed a few messages so that they use PRIVMSG when being sent to a WebTV user rather than
  using NOTICE.
- Added the TRE regex library to extras/tre (minor modifications to reduce source size)
- Made ./Config configure, compile, and install TRE
- Implemented +a/+q prefixes (#define PREFIX_AQ in config.h) read the comment above PREFIX_AQ
  in include/config.h for more information.
- Fixed PRIVMSG bug with multiple targets.
- Yet another resolver fix
- Fixed a bug with using crontab
- Docs update
- Temporarily disabled compiling TRE 
*** Unreal3.2-beta17 release *** (god save us)
- Modified './update', now points to docs until we have a new update thingy.
- Fixed bug with /list and '?' wildcard, reported by maGGus.
- Fixed a few fdlist bugs in SVSMODE/SVS2MODE found by Aither.
- IPv6: added warning if a ::ffff:a.b.c.d type addr doesn't work since this "feature"
  is disabled by default at newer *BSD versions. Also improved another warning.
- Added set::channel-command-prefix to allow channel text which starts with specific characters
  to be sent to +d clients (for in channel commands).
- Added a README
- Added some checking in fdlist add/remove functions.
- Updated docs a bit (how-to-get-support/FAQ link style).
- Rewrote the win32 editor handling of mIRC codes. The new system should be more stable,
  and it supports more features, such as background colors. Just a note, the editor should
  be able to display any mIRC code without problem, however, some codes may be changed once
  you save the file. For example, reverse is replaced with ctrl+k0,1 and color code 99 is 
  treated as a 1 if used for a text color and 0 if used for a bgcolor. This might cause
  problems when displaying in some clients, however not all clients support color code 99.
  As for the reverse, if I can come up with a decent way to still keep the original reverse
  code, I will change it to do that. So in short, if you need the color codes to stay
  _exactly_ the way they are, then you shouldn't use the editor on that file. Also, color 
  codes that are 0..9 are translated to 2 digits, ie "2" becomes "02" this is to prevent 
  problems when a number follows directly after the color code. 
- Added support for editting short motds in the win32 editor.
- Added a goto button on the win32 editor toolbar.
- Made the win32 editor window maximizable.
- Added a find text feature to the win32 editor.
- Added HOOKTYPE_LOCAL_OPER (first param = aClient of oper, second param = 1 if the user
  just became an oper, 0 if they just -o'ed)
- Added a system to allow modules to create snomasks using functions SnomaskAdd and SnomaskDel
- Fixed ban version crash and another read-after-free.
- Fixed problem with make custommodule and multiple EXLIBS arguments (EXLIBS="-la -lb -lc").
- Fixed a bug with +b and +e involving how trimming should occur when a mask is too long.
  (#0001103) reported by Troco.
- Fixed a bug in aliases reported by darko``
- Updated help.conf and unreal32docs.html (#0001111) reported by SciFi, AngryWolf, and Zerwas.
- Cleaned up some code for /die under Windows
- Fixed ircd.c compile error discovered by Ravage
- Made unreal work with Linux under PPC (#0001105,#0000929) reported by drevlan and Cruiser
  and thanks to drevlan for donating a linux ppc shell to help track down the problem
- Fixed a problem where Unreal would sometimes die without outputting information about the
  crash under Windows
- Made /restart work under Windows in NT service mode.
- Fixed a documentation typo (#0001027) reported by Soldier007
- Fixed a bunch of logging problems reported by LRL (#0001034).
- Fixed a problem with a fix for +b/+e reported by AngryWolf (#0001117)
- Fixed a documentation typo reported by Z3l3zT (#0001066)
- Clarified what ban server {} does, suggested by Joolz (#0001110)
- Fixed a problem related to crontab reported by LRL (#0001034)
- Fixed a problem in PPC detection
- Will now error at too large cloak keys (2147483647 and greater) because it's dangerous
  and could cause cloak key differences (ex: mixed ia32&ia64 networks).
- Some minor text/documentation fixes.
- First big part of modulized extended channelmodes system:
  - Adds room for at least 32 (new) channel modes.
  - Supports both paramless and 1-parameter modes.
  - Modulized: modules can add new channelmodes, but are unloadable (permanent).
  - Everything is ifdef'd, and EXTCMODE is disabled by default in config.h
  - It will send CHANMODES= in the PROTOCTL message on server link, this enables
    servers and services to see which modes are supported and of what type
    they are (1-parameter, paramless, etc).
  And now the bad part:
  - The system has not been fully tested, it will contain bugs (for example I'm
    aware of some memory leaks).
  - A few features are missing: warning/error on linking if chanmodes mismatch, unloading
    of channel modes (not planned soon), 005 broadcasts on change and maybe more..
  - The function (and maybe variable) names will be changed in the next weeks/months
  - You should be carefull with parameter modes + services. Things will get desynced
    if services don't recognize it's a parameter mode. This also applies to clients
    without 005 CHANMODES= support.
  - No documentation

  I really suggest module coders to wait a few weeks till the system is ready..
  In the meantime, don't report bugs or ask for support on this.
- Fixed bug with SWHOIS: oper::swhois wasn't broadcasted correctly which made it
  only show up in local (or server) /whois, reported by format (#0001141).
- minor m_kick tweak.
- Fixed bug in /silence regarding cloaked hosts, reported by kuwatog (#0001157).
- Fixed a problem with a Sleep call on win32
- Rewrote the /stats system. The new system allows for long flags for example
  /stats gline to list glines rather than just /stats G (old flags are still
  supported). Additionally, for glines an extended syntax is now supported allowing
  more refined searches. /stats G +m *@*.aol.com lists only glines that match that 
  mask. For more info do /stats ?. 
- Added stats flags for except throttle and ban version blocks
- stats bugfixes: a null pointer crash and a '/stats k' bug.
- Fixed a couple of problems in the new stats system
- Fixed another stats problem, reported by Angrywolf (#0001163)
- Rewrote the usermode module interface to be more stable and consistent with other
  module functions. New functions are UmodeAdd and UmodeDel (backwards compatibility
  is available for the old functions).
- Fixed a bug in the snomask and umode system dealing with removing flags
- Added two module functions ModuleGetOptions and ModuleSetOptions to retrieve/toggle
  module options
- Fixed a bug effecting +k/+L where you could /mode #chan +k test, /mode #chan +k test
  and each time it would send a mode change (#0001170) reported by Airnike.
- A few documentation updates/fixes
- 005 CHANMODES= set back to original value before extcmode merge
- made some functions in channel.c non-static so module coders
  can use them (they are not defined in the header files [yet] however).
- fixed 2 minor oob write issues
- Fixed a bug with stats l/L
- Updated example.conf with a more strict default oper-only-stats.
- Made '/stats S' and '/stats Z' oper only again (always).
- Hopefully fixed incoming/outgoing rate in /stats T. Only the stats of the first
  listener was counted instead of the total. This also explains why on some (many?)
  ircd configurations it always showed 0.00 kb/s and why HTM (high traffic mode)
  was never kicking in.
- A few doc updates (example.conf).
- Added EOS command (End Of Sync), which is sent between servers after a server has
  succesfully synced (after introducing of channels, users, etc). This way we can
  easily distinct between linked servers and a connecting server.
  This is needed / very helpful for: snomask +F, new +f anti flood system, prolly
  other things as well. Services don't support this command, but it's not
  needed atm since +F/+f both ignore U lines.
- Internal: changed 2 MyMalloc's to MyMallocEx (mem zerofill).. nothing was currently
  affected by this but it's easy to forget if you add new stuff.
- Fixed minor /WALLOPS bug reported by Praetorian_ (#0001195).
- Internal code cleanups: EOS var rename, got rid of old UnknownUser structs, moved
  anti away flood to new flood struct.
- Changed away flood configuration to set::anti-flood::away-flood <count>:<period>.
- Added nickflood protection, can be set in set::anti-flood::nick-flood <count>:<period>
  to allow max 'count' nickchanges per 'period' seconds. The default is 3 per 60s.
  As usual, the nickchange limiting does not apply to ircops.
- Allow o/a/q'd users to nickchange if banned (#0001150).
- Added badword all { }, this will add the badword to the badword channel, badword message
  and badword quit lists... could be useful :p.
- Little config.h cleanup (removed obsolete non-working defines).
- Allow opers to talk in channel even if +m (#0001109).
- Implemented the *nix resolver under windows. This should solve 90% of the problems that
  exist in the Windows version. There may be some problems with the resolver that still
  need to be worked out, however it should be much more stable than before. Some of this
  code is based on the ircu Windows NT port by run.
- Fixed a problem with /quote dns i
- Rewrote a whole bunch of stuff in the extcmode code
- Extended the module system to allow better error reporting using ModuleGetError and
  ModuleGetErrorStr
- Changed channel mode +f, it's a much more advanced antiflood mode now.
  It can protect against joinfloods, ctcpfloods, nickfloods and message/notice floods.
  For example +f [10j]:15 allows 10 joins per 15 seconds, if the limit is reached the
  channel is set automatically +i (invite only) by the server.
  You can read more about it in section 3.12 'Anti-Flood features' of unreal32docs.html:
  http://www.vulnscan.org/UnrealIrcd/unreal32docs.html#feature_antiflood
  This change can cause desynch problems if both old+f and new+f servers are used on
  a network. It's (currrently!) possible to use the old +f system if you undef NEWCHFLOODPROT
  in include/config.h.
- Fixed ~5 compiler warnings at *NIX and ~20 at windows. Some of them _could_ have caused problems.
- Moved EOS debugging code to DEBUGMODE.
- Fixed a channel sync bug reported by thilo&Rocko (#0001218).
- Fixed minor config parser memleak reported by AngryWolf (#0001214).
- Fixed bug regarding hidden opers + m_whois cleanup (#0001208).
- Made SSL users unable to -z themselves, also added 2 flags to /stats S,
  reported by Joolz (#0001200).
- Fixed problem with opers having both 'admin' and 'coadmin' causing double-notices (#0001043).
- +f now also allows you to specify an 'action'. For example +f [30j#R]:15 will set the
  channel +R (instead of +i) if more than 30 joins in 15 seconds are reached.
  The following combinations are allowed: c#m, c#M, j#R and m#M. (docs will be updated later)
- Probably fixed a bug regarding 'setting mode' notice with +f (was sometimes sent to non-chanops).
- Fixed multiple chmode +u bugs: remote join, netjoin, +mu relay between servers, kick and
  a part bug. Most of them reported by Lx (#0001097).
- Fixed a bug in +f + modes-on-join + 't' subfloodtype, reported by Rocko (#0001228).
- Fixed a crashbug with +f and services, reported by Rocko (#0001227).
- And another +f + modes-on-join one...
- Made anti away flood system work just like anti nick flood (#0001205).
  NO_FLOOD_AWAY is now enabled and away-flood is set to 4 per 120s by default.
- Fixed a double OperOverride notice bug reported by DukePyrolator (#0001180).
- Doc fixes/updates reported by Angrywolf (#0001163, #0001176).
- Fixed a /rehash crash regarding badword all & regex badwords, reported by Angrywolf (#0001230).
- Fixed an old bug where allow::hostname localhost (or *@localhost) didn't work (#0001115).
- Fixed a chroot bug, reported by iceblade (#0001112).
- Badwords filtering is now only done for local clients, previously every server was filtering
  the message. This will reduce CPU usage, especially at hubs (#0001022).
- Will now strip/block color codes in quits if any channel the user is in has mode +S/+c.
- Temporarely added trace code for hunting down negative operator counts (#0001155).
- Made it so that with +M and user not +r and not voice/halfop/ops/etc the part message isn't
  shown, just like with +m.
- Added warn option to deny channel, this will send a notice to the eyes snomask when a user
  attempts to join. Suggested by Joolz (#0000992).
- Added clientsonly/serversonly/ssl/java flags to /stats P (#0000992).
- Added official-channels block. These channels are listed in /list even if they have 0 users.
- Fixed a crashbug introduced by +mu fixes 3 days ago (#0001237).
- Fixed a typo where /knock would say the channel is +I if +V is set, reported by Certus
- Improved SSL error msg sent to junk snomask.
- Fixed Q:lined nickname msgs during linking and a debug fix.
- Fixed a SVSMOTD crashbug (removing of motd).
- Fix-for-fix-for-+mu-fix (it was still crashing)... don't ask.
- Minor +f code tweaks.
- Added checks for ipv4 listen lines on ipv6 compile.
- Finished some of the extcmode code (memleaks).
- Fixed a problem in the new win32 resolver code
- Added HOOKTYPE_UNKUSER_QUIT (disconnects of unregistered clients).
- Fixed a Linux PPC problem (#0001242)
- Made the win32 version use libtre for regex rather than GNU regex
  libtre is smaller, faster, and more feature rich.
- Fixed some issues regarding unsetting of -R/-M when server set that mode due to a flood (+f),
  it would set the mode back immediately after next msg/join, counters are now reset.
- Updated documentation
- Added set::default-bantime. It allows you to set the default time for a gline/kline/gzline/
  shun/etc when the time is not not specified (like with /gline *@*.stupid.net).
- Added HOOKTYPE_LOCAL_PASS and HOOKTYPE_REMOTE_CONNECT
- Added HOOKTYPE_REMOTE_QUIT
- Added beta18 release notes (might be changed)
- Added HOOKTYPE_REHASHFLAG (triggered when /rehash is passed a flag)
- Fix for HOOKTYPE_REMOTE_QUIT (was called for local quits too)
- Redid the join/kick/topic hooks
- Added a few macros (MOD_HEADER, MOD_INIT, MOD_TEST, MOD_LOAD, MOD_UNLOAD) to make
  setting up a module for both static and dynamic linking easier
- Fixed a win32 resolver lockup bug
- Fixed hunt_server* bug
- Very Very small change to doc/example.conf
- Updated .CHANGES.NEW to read Beta18
- Minor doc update.
- Updated all the modules to use the new macros
- Changed version to 'beta18'
- Fixed a problem with tre.dll
- Rewrote some of the message searching code to make it roughly 25% faster
- Minor botmotd-on-mode+B fix.
- Added a "command override" system for modules (experimental)
- Fixed some documentation typos (#0001273) reported by AngryWolf
- Fixed a bug where SVSNOOP could cause negative oper counts
- Fixed even more negative oper count bugs:
  1) if services would do a '-o' via svsmode/svs2mode on a +H person (instead of -oH)
  2) services setting +H on a non-oper
  3) services making someone a global oper while he's already local op might cause confusion.
  4) if local opers would do /mode nick +H
  5) Some false warnings (negative opercount) if services would do -Ho (-oH went fine)
- Fixed a problem with HTM where it would never actually read messages from clients
- Made /who limit output (uses set::who-limit) (#0001244) suggested by Exael23 
- Made /who * disabled (for non-opers) in HTM mode
- Added usermode +T - No CTCP (excludes ACTION and DCC), (#001288) suggested by White_Magic
  and others.
- Optimized the channel privmsg/notice code again (sendto_channelprefix_butone_tok),
  now ~33% faster.
- Yet another code audit:
  - (Just for the record, this audit has nothing to do with the ircnet buffer overflow,
     unrealircd is not vulnerable)
  - Various fixes
  - Visual bug regarding +f & server synching, it was sometimes setting mode +f multiple
    times depending on the ban-/userlist.
  - Fixed a possible desynch regarding chmode +L.
  - Fixed possible client confusion regarding bans.
- Now it would be even better if it actually compiles...
- Optimized send code re-enabled, I disabled it 6h ago due a bug-triggering-a-bug (see next).
- Fixed a PING bug resulting in 'trying to send .. to myself' msg.
- Some spelling corrections in unreal32docs.html.
- Added checks for /sethost&/chghost to same host.
- Added remove-chanmode-after-X-minutes in +f.
  The format is +f [30j#R5]:15, where 5 is the "do -R after 5 minutes". For a default
  action like +i you would have to do the same: +f [30j#i5]:15 (remove 'i' after 5 minutes).
  Additionally, 2 config items are added:
  - set::modef-default-unsettime, if this is set to for example '5' then things like
    +f [30j]:15 will be transormed into +f [30j#i5]:15. It's just a default, the user can still
    override it. By default this feature is not used.
  - set::modef-max-unsettime, specifies the maximum amount of time for the <time> parameter,
    by default this is set to 60 (=1 hour), the value should be between 0 and 255.
  I didn't do the extended tests I usually do but it seems stable, also the docs are updated
  but are probably updated again later to make it a bit more readable.
  Feel free to report any bugs as soon as you discover them.
  The only thing I could think of is: _usually_ only 1 server will have the -i/-R/.. timer
  running, so if that server splits (or even worse dies) it will only be -i/-R/.. at that server
  and when they sync back they merge chanmodes so +i/+R is set again.
  I don't consider this a huge problem but maybe it can be inconveniently, if people have
  a lot of trouble with this I'll have to consider a 50% recode of the +f system :/.
- Fixed gline with weird value causing a crash at windows, reported by Spectre (#0001309).
- Fix for +L without +l desynch on serverlinking.
- Fixed a problem regarding module hooks, if a hook was called within a hook it could cause
  problems (like pre connect hook -> exit_client -> quit hook).
- Changed some useless stuff.
- Enabled EXTCMODE by default, I presume it's stable but can't promise anything.
- Module coders: changed 'allowed' callback function for umodes&snomasks,
  from 'aClient *sptr' to 'aClient *sptr, int what'.
  'what' will be MODE_ADD if trying to add and MODE_DEL if trying to remove.
- Added HOOKTYPE_REMOTE_NICKCHANGE (called like: cptr, sptr, newnick).
- Fixed a bug regarding +f and bounce modes, would cause a crash, reported by Rocko.
- Made it so the dccdeny system can now check files that contain spaces (suggested by
  Lamego)
- Added set::options::allow-part-if-shunned. Sometimes shunned users close a channel
  window, most irc clients just close the window immediately and send a part msg..
  they don't wait for the server to confirm the part and thus the user thinks he has left
  the channel while in fact he has not... this can be annoying if you are temporarely
  shunning n00bs for a few minutes, they won't understand why they get a 'You are already
  on that channel' error msg when they try to join that chan again.
  This is however disabled by default because the idea of shun is to totally shun a user
  so (s)he can't do anything except /admin (and thus not causing "any" [server]traffic).
  Suggested by brentos. Note that we won't support /quit, or any other command, just this.
- Module coders: Moved call to HOOKTYPE_LOCAL_JOIN down to where the JOIN, NAMES, etc
  are already sent... this seems to make more sense since we have a prejoin hook now.
- Moved it a bit too far (outside the loop), should be fixed now.
- Fixed bug where color quits were stripped when they shouldn't be >:).
- Added 'action' field to ban version { } which can be: kill: kills the user (default),
  tempshun: shun the specific connection only, kline/zline/gline/gzline/shun: place
  a ban on *@IP. Time of those bans can be specified in set::ban-version-tkl-time.
  It's up to the admin to take a good decision, sometimes zlines are best (=won't use
  much sockets but will reconnect quite quickly), sometimes tempshun (=will use 1 socket
  but generates nearly no network traffic), sometimes klines/glines, etc..
- Added sendto_umode_raw, sends to umodes, but not as a NOTICE
- Added hook HOOKTYPE_CHANNEL_CREATE (cptr(user creating channel), chptr
  (channel that has gotten created)
- Added hook HOOKTYPE_CHANNEL_DESTROY (chptr (channel getting destroyed))
- Minor doc updates regarding snomasks reported by Stoebi (#0001324).
- Fixed two OperOverride kick bugs:
  - If ircop is +h and victim is +h it would deny it, reported by Special (#0001308)
  - Ircops (all except netadmin) had trouble kicking +q people, if the ircop isn't
    op'ed he can kick them, but if he has +o he can't. Reported by Michi (#0001012).
  If you use mixed unreal versions you can get desynch problems if you use those
  fixed things (like kick a +h if you are +h) because older servers will still block
  the kick. You will receive a 'You cannot kick channel' message from every older
  server so you'll at least be notified ;p.
- Don't allow remote pongs if unregistered.
- (Internal) Added __attribute__ format checking for most format string functions,
  this will currently produce a lot of warnings with -Wall.
- Fixed 159 of 184 warnings detected by the above, the other warnings are false.
  Most warnings had to do with long vs int, and thus the format strings (%d->%ld)
  or the vars (int->long) have been changed (many of these were time_t/TS vs int).
  Only a few rare crashbugs were discovered.
- Module coders: for HOOKTYPE_LOCAL_CHANMODE the 'sendts' parameter was changed
  from type 'int' to 'time_t', while in most circumstances (like on ia32)
  you won't notice, I suggest you to update your callback functions anyway.
- Possibly fixed an issue with set::modes-on-join and mode +f, it could have
  set random remove-chanmode times in the default chanmode line.
- Fixed some other weird remote PING/PONG stuff as well.
- Fixed a bug where link::options::autoconnect wasn't working after rehash, ircd
  had to be restarted to make it work. Will now try to connect on /rehash to
  servers with autoconnect enabled. Bug was reported by Rocko (#0001321).
- Added insane OperOverride system for joining +z channels (#0001189).
  This seems better than just allowing the insecure oper trough +z.
- Fixed a UMODE2 bug.
- Made it so chanmode +f flood detection doesn't apply to u-lined servers. This was
  already indirectly the case because services don't support the EOS command, but
  now some (homemade) services do :p. Reported by Troco (#0001337).
- (Internal) Moved most valid-host checking into 1 function, valid_host(),
  which checks for invalid characters.
- Added hostname check for me::name since this could cause mysterious trouble.
- Removed references to tkline/tzline from help.conf. Reported by penna22 (#0001340)
- Fix for permanent modules w/ config hooks (they were not called).
- Fixed desynch bug regarding extended channelmodes. Reported by AngryWolf (#0001347)
- Multiple /module changes (the command):
  - Normal users can now get a list, versioninfo will be hidden however.
  - Opers get some additional details like hooks and commandoverride's.
  - Opers can use /module <servername> to get a remote list of loaded modules.
  - Added flag [3RD] to show it's a 3rd party module
  This was requested by by quite some people because serveradmins started to load
  "spy modules" without clearly mentioning it in the MOTD (which is highly unethical
  and in some countries even illegal due to privacy law). Also the remote module
  list was requested by quite a few opers.
  Sure, this isn't a 100% guarantee but at least if someone goes hiding stuff
  then it's clear what their intentions are (and thus will be refused support, ..).
- Changed emailaddr in help window at windows to unreal-users mailinglist.
- Made the cloak mismatch msg during linking a bit more scary.
- Added comment to 'Install as a service' option in installer to help n00bs a bit.
- Made win32 work again (broke it by /module patch 30 minutes ago).
- Fixed a snomask issue reported by Magnet (#0001354).
- Added oper::maxlogins which allows you to limit the number of concurrent session
  with the same oper block. Suggested by kain.
- Made /dns oper-only (the ircd command, not your client /dns command :p).
- Various help.conf fixes. Reported by nukie (#0001373).
- Fixed remote BOTMOTD bug reported by Angrywolf (#0001365).
- Workaround for "special ban makes it impossible to add other bans" bug
  reported by wilkie, SerialKillinNinja, etc. 
- Made /rehash reread botmotd and opermotd (#0001291).
- Made OperOverride work for chanmode +Q (#0001370).
- A few example.conf changes.
- Fixed a compile problem on alpha, reported by Hyperi (#0001374).
- Made "operator count bug" not notice all opers (log only), unless in debugmode.
- Added comment regarding MLOCK and set::restrict-chanmodes in unreal32docs.html.
- Made PREFIX_AQ a ./Config question at *NIX and enabled it by default at Win32.
- Added stuff that will ease the transition to extended bans next release.
- Added beta19 release notes
- Made USE_ZIP the default again in src/win32/unrealinst.iss
- Changed version to beta19
- A last-minute fix, lalala...
*** beta19 release ***
- Changed the HOOKTYPE_REHASHFLAG syntax to (aClient *cptr, aClient *sptr, char *flag)
  requested by AngryWolf (#0001365)
