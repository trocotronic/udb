Unreal3.2.3 Release Notes
==========================

==[ GENERAL INFORMATION ]==
- If you are upgrading on *NIX, make sure you run 'make clean' and './Config'
  first before doing 'make'
- The official UnrealIRCd documentation is doc/unreal32docs.html
  online version at: http://www.vulnscan.org/UnrealIrcd/unreal32docs.html
  FAQ: http://www.vulnscan.org/UnrealIrcd/faq/
  Read them before asking for help.
- Report bugs at http://bugs.unrealircd.org/
- When upgrading a network, we assume you are upgrading from the previous
  version (3.2.2). If you got a net running with servers that are several
  versions behind (eg: 3.2.1) then you might experience (desynch) problems.
  Also, if you try to use the new features, some might not work properly
  until all your servers are upgraded. It is therefore recommended to
  upgrade all servers in a 'short' time span (x day[s], not weeks).

==[ NEW ]==
- Channel mode +I (invex, invite exceptions). Users on this list can join +i channels
  without needing an /invite.
- Channel mode +j (jointhrottle). If you set +j X:Y you limit each user (individually)
  to X joins per Y seconds to the channel.
- Nick Character System: this allows you to choose which additional characters to
  allow in nicknames by language (and codepage). Currently available are:
  catalan, dutch, french, german, swiss-german, icelandic, italian, spanish,
  swedish, hungarian, polish, romanian, slovak, czech, greek, turkish, russian,
  hebrew and chinese. There are also several 'groups' available, for more info see:
  http://www.vulnscan.org/UnrealIrcd/unreal32docs.html#feature_nickchars
- *NIX: ./Config -advanced, allows you to choose more options
- tld::botmotd and tld::opermotd
- Using /INVITE with no parameters will a list of channels you are invited to
  but have not yet joined.
- set::gline-address, works just like set::kline-address but then for glines.
- Added a basic regex tutorial in unreal32docs.html
- /SAJOIN now supports multiple channels (and '0') again.
- Spamfilter topic support ('t' in spamfilter, 'topic' in conf).
- Added a feature to +b/+e ~c: ~c:[prefix]<#channel>. This can be used if you for
  example trust all ops of #leet: mode #x +e ~c:@#leet.
- Various translated documents in doc/: unreal32docs.gr.html (Greek), help.fr.conf
  and example.fr.conf (French), help.de.conf & example.de.conf (German), and
  example.hu.conf (Hungarian).

==[ CHANGED ]==
- Updated auspice.conf
- The usual doc updates, help.conf, spamfilter.conf, dccallow.conf, etc.
- The config parser got (mostly) recoded. This makes it rehash much faster,
  additionally "duplicate item" checking is now available.
- Added a 'B' flag to /who output for bots. Also normal users can now /who +m B.
- Support in configfiles for \\ (= a \)
- set::dns::bind::ip, hardly useful for anyone
- If a user is +b on a channel, and set::allow-userhost-change force-rejoin is
  in use, then a part/join is not sent in order to prevent flooding.
- OperOverride INVITE notices are now sent out globally to all +s +e users.
- User mode 'g' is now operonly, it hardly did anything for non-opers.
- Made CIDR no longer accept bitmasks with less than 16bits for /*line commands.
- Modulized a lot of commands (~5000 lines of code).
- Made channel modes +c/+S deal with RGB color codes.
- If no log { } block is present, then a warning will be printed and we will log
  by default to ircd.log (errors only).
- If an invalid character is found in a nick then the whole nick is rejected now.
- Changed numeric&text of 'is a Secure Connection' to 'is using a Secure Connection',
  client coders are encouraged to add support for this new numeric 671. Until then,
  in-window-/whois's will probably be broken.
- A locops with can_override/can_gkline/can_gzline is now automatically converted
  to a globop, just like we do with can_globalroute/can_gkline. These privileges
  are GLOBAL and therefore are not meant to be granted to locops.
- A warning is now sent to an oper if (s)he tries to use /(G)ZLINE on a host.
  (G)ZLINES should be placed on *@ipmasks because they are processed before any
  ident and host lookups.
- Made (fast) badwords work better with word boundaries, in practice this means
  blocking of words with accents/umlauts/es-zett/etc now works properly.
- Made it so halfops can now -h themselves and chanadmins can -a themselves.
- Made spamfilter 'u' also check nickchanges.

==[ MAJOR BUGS FIXED ]==
- Serious crashbug [this is the same fix that was fixed by the hotfix/3.2.2b]
- TRE mem corruption- & crash-bugs (eg: in backreferences).

==[ MINOR BUGS FIXED ]==
- Made kline/shun/zline/gzline without parameters report the correct stats(flag).
- Made a few more errors send out to all opers, such as link::bind-ip problems.
- A few missing operflags in /STATS O (and SVSO)
- DCC Spamfilter was not always working correctly
- OperOverriding to, for example, a +zi channel did not print the special join notice.
- Servers behind ulines were not properly ulined, one effect that had was causing
  an odd view in /MAP if you had flat-map + hide ulines + a juped server in services.
- Made SVSMODE -b/-e remove bans/excepts placed on IPs
- The set::htm::incoming-rate config item was not working correctly
- If a user was +R then remote server notices were accidently also filtered.
- A locop setting MODE #CHAN +O caused a desynch
- Resolver sometimes incorrectly aliased names, causing incorect TTLs etc.
- Fixed SVSNOOP not removing ALL oper status properly.
- 'shun' target was not working for spamfilter and ban version { }
- Removing of shuns placed on IP's did not take effect immediately (had to reconnect).
- Fixed a bug in mode skipping (eg: '+qk a b' if not +q) and error msgs.
- Chanmode +f #t (per-user text limit) now no longer affects halfops.
- Opers w/can_override can now +qa/-qa if they are not netadmins, also affected +L/+u.
  Be sure you upgrade all servers to 3.2.3 if using these new abilities, or else you
  will get desynch issues.
- Fixed several /SAMODE bugs as well, regarding non-netadmins, being halfop'ed, etc.
- /GZLINE [nick] was placing a *line on *@host instead of *@IP, fixed.
- alias::format in combination with ::type 'command' caused a crash
- zlib upgraded to 1.2.2, curl upgraded to 7.13.1, both fix various issues.
- Win32 installer now also installs doc\technical\*.*
- Desynch issues regarding +s/+p and +c/+S
- /SAMODE causing a 'fishy timestamp' if a cmode with a digit parameter was used.

==[ REMOVED ]==
- NAZIISH_CHBAN_HANDLING (did not work at all)
- The 'oldcloak' cloaking module is now removed, since this old algorithm got broken
  8 months ago, nobody should be using it anymore.

==[ ADDITIONAL INFO ]==
