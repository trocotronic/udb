Unreal3.2.8-RC1 Release Notes
==============================

==[ GENERAL INFORMATION ]==
- If you are upgrading on *NIX, make sure you run 'make clean' and './Config'
  first, before doing 'make'
- The official UnrealIRCd documentation is doc/unreal32docs.html
  online version at: http://www.vulnscan.org/UnrealIRCd/unreal32docs.html
  FAQ: http://www.vulnscan.org/UnrealIRCd/faq/
  Read them before asking for help.
- Report bugs at http://bugs.unrealircd.org/
- When upgrading a network, we assume you are upgrading from the previous
  version (3.2.7). Upgrading from 3.2.6 or 3.2.5 should also be no problem.
  However, if you have a network running with servers that are several versions behind
  (eg: 3.2.1) then you might experience small (desynch) problems.
  Please also minimize the time you have multiple versions running, a few days or
  one week is generally not a problem, but having mixed versions on a network for several
  weeks or months is not recommended.
- The purpose of the sections below (NEW, CHANGED, MINOR, etc) is to be a SUMMARY of
  the changes in this release. There have been XX+ changes, and trying to mention them
  all would be useless, see the Changelog for the full list of changes.

==[ NEW ]==
- set::level-on-join: this defines which privilegs a user receives when creating a
  channel, default is 'chanop', the only other available setting is 'none' (opless).
- Away notification through WATCH: This allows clients to recieve a notification
  when someone goes away or comes back, along with a reason, a bit like IM's.
  There's probably no current client supporting this but it would be a nice feature
  in notify lists. Client developers: see Changes file for full protocol details.
  This feature can be disabled by setting set::watch-away-notification to 'no'.
- Spamfilter: Slow spamfilter detection: For each spamfilter, Unreal will check,
  each time it executes, how long it takes to execute. When a certain threshold is
  reached the IRCd will warn or even remove the spamfilter. This could prevent a
  spamfilter from completely stalling the IRCd. Warning is configured through
  set::spamfilter::slowdetect-warn (default: 250ms) and automatic deletion is
  configured by set::spamfilter::slowdetect-fatal (default: 500ms).
  You can set both settings to 0 (zero) to disable slow spamfilter detection.
  This feature is currently not available on Windows.
- SSL: set::ssl::server-cipher-list can be used to limit the allowed ciphers
- SSL: To specify when an SSL session key should be renegotiated you can use
  set::ssl::renegotiate-bytes <bytes> and set::ssl::renegotiate-timeout <seconds>.
- UHNAMES support: This sends the full nick!ident@host in NAMES which can be
  used by clients for their IAL. mIRC, Klient, etc support this.
- There have also been some behavior changes, which can be considered NEW, see
  next section (CHANGED).

==[ CHANGED ]==
- IPv6: On IPv6 servers you no longer have to use ::ffff:1.2.3.4 IP's for IPv4 in the
  config file, you can use the simple 1.2.3.4 form, as they are converted automatically.
- When someone is banned and /PARTs, the part reason (comment) is no longer shown
- ChanMode +S/+c: now strips/blocks 'reverse' as well
- Smart banning is now disabled by default because it was too annoying, this means that
  f.e. if there's a ban on *!*@*.com then you can still add a ban on *!*@*.aol.com
- except ban { } now also protects against ZLINEs and ban ip { }
- Modules: user modes and channel modes without parameters (eg: +X) no longer have
  to be PERManent, this means they can be upgraded/reloaded/unloaded on-the-fly.

==[ MAJOR BUGS FIXED ]==
- Zip links issue (Overflowed unzipbuf)
- Crash issue with 3rd party modules that introduce new channelmodes w/parameters
- Mac OS X: Various issues which prevented the IRCd from booting up
- A few rare crash issues, including a crash when linking to another server

==[ MINOR BUGS FIXED ]==
- CGI:IRC: Several IPv6 issues, both on IPv6 IRCd's and CGI:IRC gateways
- IP masks in oper::from::userhost sometimes didn't match when they should
- (G)ZLINE's on IPv6 users were sometimes rejected
- CHROOTDIR works again
- And more... see Changelog

==[ KNOWN ISSUES ]==
- Regexes: Be careful with backreferences (\1, etc), certain regexes can slow the IRCd
  down considerably and even bring it to a near-halt. In the spamfilter user target it's
  usually safe though. Slow spamfilter detection can help prevent the slowdown/freeze,
  but might not work in worst-case scenario's.
- Regexes: Possessive quantifiers such as, for example, "++" (not to be confused with "+")
  are not safe to use, they can easily freeze the IRCd.

==[ ADDITIONAL INFO ]==
