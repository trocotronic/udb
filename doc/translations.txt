==[ Translations ]============================================================

Starting with the release of Unreal 3.2 we have begun accepting translated
documentation files. For now, only translations of unreal32docs.html are
accepted but this might change in the future (we'll see how this goes first).

There a few requirements however:
- When you submit your translation it should be a translation of the
  very latest doc... So be sure to translate the cvs version of
  unreal32docs.html (www.vulnscan.org/UnrealIrcd/unreal32docs.html).
- Of course the translation should be correct.. So also 'technically',
  it's therefore recommended that have some real experience with Unreal ;)
- Someone (usually the person who translated it) needs to be willing
  to actively maintain the docs. This is very important! If docs are
  out of date (out-of-synch) there will be confusion among users.
  Translators will receive once a week (and right before every release)
  all changes that were made in unreal32docs.html. Then the translator
  should update his/her doc and send it in (or commit it via cvs).
  Count on an average of 15 minutes a week (it varies).

Now why would you do all this? The first-time translation of unreal32docs.html
is definitely a lot of work, but... once you are done it's just a matter
of updating once a week, many users will be happy with your translation,
and you just helped UnrealIRCd becoming a bit more 'international' :).

If you want to start translating a document, please send a mail to the
coders mailing list (coders@lists.unrealircd.org) and mention the language
you are willing to translate to...
You'll then receive an email back saying you can go ahead (or not).
This is mainly to avoid multiple persons working on the same translation.
